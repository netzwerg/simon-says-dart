What is this?
-------------
* Classic "Simon Says" game
* Implemented in [AngularDart](https://angulardart.org)
* Optimized for usage with [MakeyMakey](http://makeymakey.com)
* Look & Feel inspired by [uxmonk](http://labs.uxmonk.com/simon-says/)

Can I play it?
--------------
Yes! A beta version is deployed [here](http://netzwerg.ch/simon/index.html).

It only works with the latest Chrome or Firefox versions (Safari seems to get stuck with web-audio).

And behind the scenes?
-------------------------
* `dart:async` for button sequence animations
* `dart:web_audio` for Ogg audio support

Why is it in German?
--------------------
Game instructions are in German because I built the game for my daughter. She is in 2nd grade, and I will visit
her class for some MakeyMakey fun soon.
