Classic "Simon Says" game, implemented in [AngularDart](https://angulardart.org), optimized for usage with
[MakeyMakey](http://makeymakey.com), inspired by [uxmonk](http://labs.uxmonk.com/simon-says/).

Deployed beta version [here](http://netzwerg.ch/simon/index.html) (use latest Chrome or Firefox; Safari gets stuck with
web-audio).

Uses `dart:async` for button sequence animations and `dart:web_audio` for Ogg audio support.

_Note: Instructions are in German because I built the game for my daughter. She is in 2nd grade, and I will visit her
class for a playful MakeyMakey session soon._
